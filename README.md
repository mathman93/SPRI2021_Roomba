# SPRI2020_Roomba
Repository for Python code used on Roombas for SPRI - Summer 2020.

Welcome to the Summer Program for Research Interns (SPRI) 2019 at Clemson University. We will be using GitHub to organize and manage our Python code and other files for the project. GitHub allows us to incorporate necessary changes and updates from multiple users at the same time. Please become familiar with the layout and workflow of GitHub. Let me (mathman93) know if you have any questions.
