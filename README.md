# SPRI2021_Roomba
Repository for Python code used on Roombas for SPRI - Summer 2021.

Welcome to the Summer Program for Research Interns (SPRI) 2021 at Clemson University. We will be using GitHub to organize and manage our Python code and other files for the project. GitHub allows us to incorporate changes and updates from multiple users simultaneously, as well as easily facilitate code transfer to the Raspberry Pis. Please become familiar with the layout and workflow of GitHub. Let me (mathman93) know if you have any questions.
